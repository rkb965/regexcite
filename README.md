# regexcite

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Just working through the delightful R packages 2ed!

<!-- 
## Installation
&#10;You can install the development version of regexcite from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
&#10;``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rkb965/regexcite")
```
&#10;## Example
&#10;This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
&#10;
```r
library(regexcite)
## basic example code
```
&#10;What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
&#10;
```r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```
&#10;You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
&#10;You can also embed plots, for example:
&#10;<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />
&#10;In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
